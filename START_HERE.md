"When immigrant families move to a new country, they struggle with questions like 'Where's the cheapest grocery store?' or 'Which daycare fits my budget?'

Most finance apps only track spending. **Masari Family** helps families make BETTER spending decisions with three unique features:

1. AI onboarding that feels like talking to a friend
2. Gamified lessons with points and celebrations
3. Local recommendations for affordable services

We're helping families thrive in a new country—one local choice at a time."
