### Step 2: Add API Key to Your App

static const String _apiKey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY_HERE';
```

**Replace with your key:**
```dart
static const String _apiKey = 'AIzaSyB...'; // Paste your actual key
```

**Save the file!**

---

### Step 3: Test It!

```bash
flutter run
```

**Demo Flow:**
1. Language selection
2. Register
3. **Onboarding** - Enter **real location**:
   - ❌ Bad: "New York" (too vague)
   - ✅ Good: "New York, NY" or "Manhattan, New York"
   - ✅ Better: "Times Square, New York, NY"
4. Complete onboarding
5. Go to **Explore tab**
6. **See real businesses!** 🎉

## 📍 Location Accuracy Tips

### For Best Results:
- Include city AND state: "San Francisco, CA"
- Include neighborhood: "Brooklyn, New York, NY"
- Include ZIP code: "90210, Los Angeles, CA"

### Examples:
- ✅ "Chicago, IL"
- ✅ "Austin, Texas"
- ✅ "Miami Beach, FL"
- ✅ "Seattle, WA"
- ❌ "Downtown" (too vague)
- ❌ "USA" (too broad)

---

## 🎯 How It Works

```
User enters: "San Francisco, CA"
        ↓
1. Geocoding API converts to coordinates
   → Lat: 37.7749, Lng: -122.4194
        ↓
2. Places API searches nearby
   Category: Groceries → Type: supermarket
   Radius: 5km
        ↓
3. Returns real businesses:
   - Whole Foods Market
   - Safeway
   - Trader Joe's
   - Local markets
   (with ratings, distance, prices)
        ↓
4. Display in app
   Sorted by distance
   Filterable by category
```

## 💰 Cost (FREE for Hackathon!)

### Google Places Free Tier:
- **5,000 requests/month** - FREE
- After that: $17 per 1,000

### Your Usage Estimate:
- User searches 4 categories = 4 requests
- 100 users × 4 = 400 requests
- **Well within free tier!** ✅

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### With API Key (Real Data):
1. User enters "Austin, TX"
2. App shows loading: "Finding local deals..."
3. **Real Austin businesses appear!**
4. Ratings from Google reviews
5. Actual distances calculated

### Without API Key (Fallback):
1. Shows curated recommendations
2. Still works perfectly!
3. Generic but useful

---

## 🎯 For Your Demo

### Option A: With API Key (Impressive!)

**Setup before demo:**
- Get API key (10 min)
