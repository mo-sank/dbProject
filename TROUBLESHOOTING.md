### 5. Hot Reload Not Working

**Error:**
```
Hot reload not supported
```

**Solutions:**
- Press `R` (capital R) for hot restart
- Stop app and run again: `flutter run`
- Check if you edited `main()`
- Hot reload doesn't work after changing:

- Note the line numbers

**Common causes:**
1. **Missing asset**: Check `pubspec.yaml` assets section
2. **Null safety**: Add null checks
3. **Missing dependency**: Run `flutter pub get`
4. **Platform-specific issue**: Check native code

**Debug mode:**
```bash
flutter run --debug
flutter logs
```

---

### 11. Build Size Too Large

**Issue:** APK/IPA size is very large

**Solutions:**

**Reduce size:**
```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

**Enable obfuscation:**
```bash
flutter build apk --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/debug-info
```

**Remove unused code:**
- Run `flutter analyze`
- Remove unused imports
- Remove unused assets

---

### 12. Slow Performance

**Symptoms:**
- Animations are laggy
- UI is unresponsive
- Long load times

**Solutions:**

**Run in release mode:**
```bash
flutter run --release
```

**Profile the app:**
```bash
flutter run --profile
```

**Check for issues:**
- Avoid expensive operations in `build()`
- Use `const` constructors
- Optimize images
- Reduce widget rebuilds

**Use DevTools:**
```bash
flutter pub global activate devtools
flutter pub global run devtools
```

---

### 13. Provider Not Updating UI

**Issue:** State changes but UI doesn't update

**Solutions:**

**Ensure `notifyListeners()` is called:**
```dart
void updateBudget() {
  _budget = newBudget;
  notifyListeners(); // ‚Üê Must call this!
}
```

**Use correct consumer:**
```dart
// Good
Consumer<BudgetProvider>(
  builder: (context, budget, child) => Text(budget.total)
)

// Also good
Provider.of<BudgetProvider>(context)

// Bad (won't update)
Provider.of<BudgetProvider>(context, listen: false)
```

**Check provider is registered:**
- Verify in `main.dart` MultiProvider
- Ensure widget is inside provider tree

---

### 14. Navigation Issues

**Issue:** Can't navigate between screens

**Solutions:**

**Check routes:**
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => NewScreen()),
);
```

**Check context:**
- Ensure `BuildContext` is valid
- Don't use after widget disposed

**Go back:**
```dart
Navigator.pop(context);
```

---

### 15. Assets Not Loading

**Error:**
```
Unable to load asset: assets/images/logo.png
```

**Solutions:**

**Check pubspec.yaml:**
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

**Verify file exists:**
- Check `assets/images/` directory
- Ensure file name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**Run:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
