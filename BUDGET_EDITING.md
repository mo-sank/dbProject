# 💰 Budget Editing Feature - Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. **Manual Budget Editing Screen**

|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Under $2000 | $2,000 | $600 | $400 | $300 |
| $2000-$3000 | $2,500 | $750 | $500 | $375 |
| $3000-$4000 | $3,500 | $1,050 | $700 | $525 |
| $4000-$5000 | $4,500 | $1,350 | $900 | $675 |
| $5000+ | $6,000 | $1,800 | $1,200 | $900 |

**Opening:**
> "During onboarding, the user said they make $3,000-$4,000 per month. Watch how the app automatically creates a smart budget..."

**After Onboarding:**
> "The app allocated $1,050 for housing, $700 for childcare, based on the 50/30/20 rule. But every family is different..."

*Edit amounts*

3. **Control** - Users own their financial plan
4. **Reality** - Shows actual situation
