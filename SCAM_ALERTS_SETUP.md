         location: city,
         category: 'Your Category',
         createdAt: now,
         priority: 1, // 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low
       ),
     ];
   }
   ```

2. **Customizing Location Detection**
   ```dart
   // Add new location patterns in ScamAlertService
   bool _isNewLocationType(String city, String state) {
     // Your location detection logic
     return condition;
   }
   ```

3. **Adding New Categories**

   // Update categories in ScamAlertProvider
   static const List<String> categories = [
     'All',
     'Financial',
     'Immigration',
     'Government',
     'Employment',
     'General',
     'Your New Category', // Add here
   ];
   ```

## Firebase Integration

The scam alerts are stored in Firebase Firestore with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "alert_id",
  "alert": "‚ö†Ô∏è Scam Alert: [message]",
  "tip": "[actionable tip]",
  "location": "City, State",
  "category": "Financial",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "priority": 1,
  "isActive": true
}
```

### Firebase Collections
- `scam_alerts`: Stores all scam alerts
- Queries by location, category, priority, and active status
- Automatic sorting by priority and creation date

## Customization

### Alert Messages
- Keep alerts short and clear (max 2 sentences)
- Use friendly but serious tone
- Include actionable tips
- Avoid overly technical language

### Location Detection
- Add new city/state patterns
- Customize alert types for specific regions
- Implement location-based alert frequency

### UI Customization
- Modify color schemes for different priorities
- Add new category icons
- Customize alert card layouts
- Implement custom animations

## Testing

### Mock Data
The system includes mock data for testing without Firebase:
- Sample alerts for different categories
- Various priority levels
- Different location types

### Test Scenarios
1. **Location-based alerts**: Test with different city/state combinations
2. **Category filtering**: Verify all categories work correctly
3. **Priority sorting**: Ensure high priority alerts appear first
4. **Recent filtering**: Test 7-day recent alert filtering
5. **Firebase integration**: Test with and without Firebase connection

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Validation**: All alert data is validated before storage
2. **Location Privacy**: User location is only used for alert generation
3. **Alert Verification**: Consider implementing alert verification system
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for alert generation

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Reporting**: Allow users to report new scams
2. **Alert Verification**: Community verification of alerts
3. **Multilingual Support**: Alerts in multiple languages
4. **Push Notifications**: Real-time alert notifications
5. **Analytics**: Track alert effectiveness and user engagement
6. **Machine Learning**: AI-powered scam detection
7. **Integration**: Connect with local law enforcement databases

## Support

For technical support or feature requests:
1. Check the Firebase console for data issues
2. Verify location permissions are granted
3. Test with mock data first
4. Review console logs for errors

## Best Practices

1. **Alert Quality**: Ensure all alerts are accurate and helpful
2. **User Experience**: Keep alerts concise and actionable
3. **Performance**: Limit the number of active alerts
4. **Privacy**: Respect user location privacy
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure alerts are accessible to all users
6. **Localization**: Consider cultural context for different regions
