# Masari Family - Presentation Notes

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"When immigrant families move to a new country, they face two challenges: managing money in an unfamiliar system AND finding affordable local services. Most apps only track spending. **Masari Family** helps families make *better* spending decisions by connecting them with budget-friendly local options while teaching financial skills through gamification."
